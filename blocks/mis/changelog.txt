    Replaced $facilityData global variable with fdata.
    Replaced $cfg global variable with property of Moodle config - $CFG->mis.
    Added https config option.
    Added blockwww property to tab
    Tabs now have title component used on each tab - this is important because you might have a class 'tab_profile' but actually want to title it 'account info'

    Removed all use of $SESSION and replaced with native Moodle session handling ($USER->)
    Modified base tab class to provide current students user record and id as a property
